---- REST API / JSON Requests 

--- What are Async Requests
-> Async network requests enable web pages to communicate with servers without reloading 
-> The client sends JSON requests to the server asynchronously in single-page apps.
-> The server processes the request and returns the JSON response.
-> The page updates dynamically using the received data.

--- What are REST APIs
-> REST APIs enable communication between clients and servers using HTTP.
-> They are mainly identified by a URL
-> They use standard HTTP methods like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE
-> Data is exchanged in formats like JSON or XML
-> REST APIs allow clients to access and manipulate web resources
-> REST APIs are stateless

--- Decoupling Frontend and Backend 
-> Seprating front-end and back-end allows independent development and scaling 
-> REST APIs serve as a communication layer between them
-> Frontend interacts with back-end through standardized RESTful calls.
-> Decoupling enhances flexibility and simpilfies maintenance 
-> REST APIs enable frontend updates without altering backend codes

--- Routes and HTTP methods
-> REST API routes define the endpoints (URLs) where resources can be accessed by clients.
-> GET : Retrieves data from the server at the specified routes
-> POST : Sends new data to the server to create a resource 
-> PUT : Updates or replaces an existing resource at a given route 
-> DELETE : Removes a resource from the server at the specified route
-> PATCH : Partially updates an existing resource with new data

--- REST Core Concepts
-> Statelessness : Each request contains all necessary information ; the server maintains no client sessions
-> Uniform Interface : Standardized communication using HTTP methods like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH.
-> Client-Server Separation : independent development of frontend and backend components
-> Cacheability : Responses indeicate if they can be cached to improve performance
-> Layered System : Architecture allows for multiple layers between client and servers.
-> Code on demand : Servers can extend client functionality by sending executable code
